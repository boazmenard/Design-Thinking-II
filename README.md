# Design-Thinking-II
In Sprint 2019, our Elements Of Computer Programming II course at Delaware State University had a semester long design thinking project. We had a robot (pi-car) that we had to program to be able to semi-autonomously navigate planet (maze). The robot would have to detect objects, avoid objects, and be able to communicate with starfleet command. The robot would be able to send no more than 5 messages between command to help it navigate the maze, move a moveable object, and extract a sample.

The robot only has 15 minutes to complete this.

## Group Name: Klingons

## Members: Terrell Cook, Brandon Elmore, Matthew Ward, Boaz Menard

### Tools
- Pi-Car (robot)
- Camera: to take pictures of the objects
- Laptop: acting as command to communicate with the robot

### Requirements
- Robot must navigate maze autonomously
  - The maze was black tape and the pi-car would utilze light sensor readings for autonomous driving
- Communication
  - The robot must send messages automatically without real-time commands from a user
  - Can only send and receive 5
- Objects
  - Identify which object can be moved
  - Identify which objects must be avoided
  - Identify which object is the sample
